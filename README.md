Introduction to Scripting

## ADDITIONAL FEATURES

1. I updated two components to make the game more challenging and entertaining:
	- Time Between Spawns of the Sheep Spawner from 2 to 1 
	- The Shoot Interval of the Hay Machine from 0.8 to 0.5
    
2. In order to enhance the visual experience, I added the small heart model that flies up from any saved sheep to show their appreciation.
